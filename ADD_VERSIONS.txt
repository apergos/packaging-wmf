How to add a new version to this setup:

* add the new version to the list in the known_distros file, on the same line
* make a file configs/<newdistro>_wikimedia.list based on one of the ones there already
* make a file configs/<newdistro>_deb_security.list based on one of the ones there already
* make a subdir <newdistro>
* copy the Dockerfile from some other version into it and hack away
* try building the image and the container, and commit changes when it works
